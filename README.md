# Multi-Vendor Frontend Client

This is the frontend client for the Multi-Vendor E-Commerce project, built with Next.js, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS as part of a skill assessment.

**Important Note:** The primary focus of this 24-hour task was the development of the backend API. This frontend application serves as a proof-of-concept to consume and demonstrate the core functionalities of the backend, such as user authentication and data retrieval from protected routes.
